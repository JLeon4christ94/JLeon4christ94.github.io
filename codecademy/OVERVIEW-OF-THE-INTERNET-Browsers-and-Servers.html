But how is information sent from one device to another? </p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">One way of understanding this process is to look at the <em>client-server</em> model. In this model, the <em>client</em> refers to the user’s device or program that is making a request for data. A client can be a browser or application running on a user’s laptop, smartphone, or tablet. </p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">The <em>server</em> is the device or program in that network that waits for incoming requests and sends back data. This might be an in-house server, a rented server at a data center, or cloud server. At Codecademy, we have servers that store lesson data and our servers are sending this lesson data to your client device.</p>
