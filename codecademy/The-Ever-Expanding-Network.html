In 1969, the United States Department of Defense funded the creation of <em>ARPANET</em>, a precursor network to the internet. ARPANET stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. ARPANET connected supercomputing centers run by government agencies and universities. </p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">These institutions wanted to connect their individual networks for large-scale information transfer. However, many of them followed different standards and technical implementations. In the 1970s, the <em>transmission control protocol</em> and <em>internet protocol</em>, otherwise known as TCP/IP, were created to provide standards around the transfer of data that would allow these early networks to communicate with each other. </p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">TCP/IP was researched and specified throughout the 1970s and adopted in the early 1980s. As different networks adopted TCP/IP, the interconnected global network of networks that is today known as the internet was formed.</p>
