<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">In building out the features that she needed for her business’s application, she learned about the four languages that form the core of the World Wide Web today:</p>
<ul class="styles_ul__wUqMb">
<li class="styles_li__qple6"><strong>HTML</strong> — structures website content</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6"><strong>CSS</strong> — applies styling to websites</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6"><strong>JavaScript</strong> — adds interactivity to websites</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6"><strong>SQL</strong> — allows your web application to store and retrieve data</li>
</ul>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">While these languages are each essential to web development, many of them also have applications in other fields. For example, JavaScript was initially just a language for interacting with HTML, but JavaScript has expanded to be a general-purpose programming language that can be run outside of the browser. You can now build web applications, browser games, desktop applications, and even VR/AR experiences in JavaScript.</p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">Learning web development has given Alejandra the skills that she needed for her business and also opened the door for her to take on more and more technical projects in a wide variety of fields.</p>
