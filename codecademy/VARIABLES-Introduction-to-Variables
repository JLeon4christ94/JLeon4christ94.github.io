This concept is known as a <em>variable</em>. </p>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">Maybe you’re familiar with the math term <em>variable</em>, or the word <em>variability</em>. Programming variables share qualities with each. Similar to a variable in math, a variable is a way of saving a piece of information with a specific name. By giving a value a name, we can easily reuse that value over and over again in our code. Like the idea of variability, a programming variable allows us to easily change a value throughout our code.</p>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">Variables are an important first step in coding because, with variables, we can start using an essential programming tool: repetition. Rather than writing out a piece of data every time we need it, we write it out once and the computer remembers it and can repeat that information back. </p>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">In this lesson, we’ll explore why variables are an important part of programming, including:</p>
