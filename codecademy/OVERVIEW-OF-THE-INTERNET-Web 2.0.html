<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">The earliest static websites were composed of text, images, and links, with very little interactivity beyond browsing from one page to another. These websites are called <em>static</em>, which means lacking in movement because they do not change based on user behavior. As internet connection speeds and web technologies progressed, more complex interactions became possible on the web. </p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">A collection of advances in the early 2000s created a cluster of web applications that are often called “Web 2.0”. In comparison to early static websites, Web 2.0 applications are often defined by: </p>
<ul class="styles_ul__wUqMb">
<li class="styles_li__qple6">Providing a dynamic user experience by offering content that responds to user input without forcing the page to reload. In the early web, user input would typically take the user to a new page — and they would have to wait for the new page to load. In Web 2.0, websites could just update selected regions of the page, avoiding the interruption caused by reloading.</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">Emphasizing user-generated content and social sharing. In the early web, content was generally authored by a single source. The rise of blogging, social media, and wikis in web 2.0 meant that users could generate content and share it with their friends.</li>
</ul>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">There were important technical advances that enabled each of these advances in the user interface of the internet. For example:</p>
<ul class="styles_ul__wUqMb">
<li class="styles_li__qple6"><em>jQuery</em> was the first JavaScript framework that could fetch data while the web page is running. </li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">The rise of <em>web frameworks</em> that connected to databases, like Spring, Django, and Ruby-on-Rails, enabled user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed.</li>
</ul>
