<h3 id="heading-curated-content" class="styles_h3__yZE0W">Curated Content</h3>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">Throughout this path you may see some items that aren’t made by the Codecademy team.  We’ve included these to ensure that you learn all the topics you need to get your career started. Though we didn’t write them, we’ve vetted them ourselves for technical accuracy and good teaching practices. When possible, we’ve written relevant assessments so that you can check your understanding back on our platform. </p>
<h3 id="heading-updates" class="styles_h3__yZE0W">Updates</h3>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">Since we strive to bring you the best and most up-to-date content, we will be periodically updating the materials in this path. For smaller updates we’ll be communicating changes via the <a target="_blank" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/change-log-web-development">Web Development Change Log</a>, which features updates and bug fixes across all Web Development content. For larger changes, we’ll write a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://news.codecademy.com/tag/updates/">blog post</a> detailing the extent of those changes and how they impact the syllabi.
