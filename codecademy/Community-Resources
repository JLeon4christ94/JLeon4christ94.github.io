<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">Learning a programming language can be like learning a spoken language. It’s an incredible feeling when someone speaks to you and you understand what they’re saying! But it’s much more powerful when you are able to speak in response, using the new language with others.</p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">Coding languages work similarly. To gain mastery, you must also practice using the language.
You can start practicing what you’ve learned by visiting the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://discuss.codecademy.com">Codecademy Community forums</a> or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://discord.com/invite/codecademy">Codecademy Discord Server</a>. In the community spaces, you will be able to see new posts from learners like you and test your skills by posting a response to help them. You can quickly learn about others by visiting their Codecademy Profiles, and you can introduce yourself by sharing the link to yours. </p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">The Codecademy Community is a great place to read about others’ experiences, ask questions, and get help from your peers when you are stuck. They are also a safe place to test out your new skills by helping someone else with their question.</p>
