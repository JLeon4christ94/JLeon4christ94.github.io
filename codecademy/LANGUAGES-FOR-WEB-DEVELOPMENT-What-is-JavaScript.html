She would like to build a shopping cart feature that allows her users to buy travel packages directly from her website.</p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">To accomplish this, Alejandra is going to need to learn JavaScript. Any website that provides more than just static information probably utilizes JavaScript in some way. Here are some familiar examples of website features most often built with JavaScript:</p>
<ul class="styles_ul__wUqMb">
<li class="styles_li__qple6">popup ads</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">animated graphics (2D or 3D)</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">interactive audio and video</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">maps and other features access the user’s geographic location</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">and much more!</li>
</ul>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">One of the defining features of JavaScript is its ability to respond to browser events. These events happen in real time and can be triggered by a wide variety of user interactions, including:</p>
<ul class="styles_ul__wUqMb">
<li class="styles_li__qple6">the user clicking on a button</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">the user pressing enter on their keyboard</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">a video file finishing loading</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">the user re-sizing their window</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">the user hovering over text on the webpage</li>
</ul>
