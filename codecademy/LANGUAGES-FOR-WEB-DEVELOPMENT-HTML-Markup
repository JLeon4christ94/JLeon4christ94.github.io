Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself. The same way that a teacher might “markup” a student essay by underlining topic sentences and circling spelling errors, HTML annotates the content within a web page.</p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">A teacher might use a red pen to make sure that their comments are easy to distinguish from the student’s own work. HTML separates content and annotation by using HTML tags, which are denoted by angle brackets (also known as less-than and greater-than signs).</p>
