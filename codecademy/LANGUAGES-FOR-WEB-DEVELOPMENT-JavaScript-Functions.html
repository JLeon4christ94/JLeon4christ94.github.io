Letâ€™s review:</p>
<ul class="styles_ul__wUqMb">
<li class="styles_li__qple6">Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once that can be reused over and over.</li>
<li class="styles_li__qple6">Events allow JavaScript to respond to user behaviors, like the user hovering their mouse over an HTML element or resizing their window.</li>
</ul>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">Events and functions combine to give JavaScript the ability to create interactive experiences. When an event is fired, a function is executed. This pattern is used again and again in web development to create interactive websites.</p>
