She needs her application to be able to store, retrieve, and modify data like usernames, shipping addresses, payment information, and more.</p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">In order to build out these features, Alejandra needs to learn some <strong>SQL</strong>, which stands for <strong>s</strong>tructured <strong>q</strong>uery <strong>l</strong>anguage. You might be familiar with SQL as a language that Data Analysts and Data Scientists use to query and analyze data. </p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">SQL stores information in tables, which is simply a collection of information organized into rows and columns. If you’ve worked with a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you might be familiar with working with tables. To get the information, you would write a <em>query</em>, or a  program that would retrieve data from the table.</p>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">Here’s an example of a query that would select all of the columns —the <code class="styles_code__zCrlm">*</code> keyword is a shorthand for “all”—  from the <code class="styles_code__zCrlm">page_views</code> table:</p>
<pre class="styles_pre__Auw0S"><pre><code><div data-lang="codecademy-sql" class="gamut-1u94a5d e5rxebe0"><span><span class="mtk12">SELECT</span><span class="mtk1"> *&nbsp;</span><span class="mtk12">FROM</span><span class="mtk1"> page_views;</span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br></div></code></pre></pre>
<p class="styles_p__rpZ3D">Web developers and software engineers also use SQL to build apps that can save, modify, and access data. There’s even a growing field of <em>data engineering</em>, which is a specialized subset of software engineers who ensure that the applications they are working with accurately and efficiently record all of the required data.</p>
